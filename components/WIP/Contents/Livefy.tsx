            <Description>
                Do you ever feel like you have forgotten something in the past ? But you can&apos;t remember what is going
                on in the past right ?
                <br /><br />
                So I made this web app to keep track of what you doing in a day.
                <br /><br />
                Don&apos;t worry I&apos;m not gonna collect of your data on the app because
                I also gonna use this web app for my daily life to keep track 
                of what I&apos;m doing in a day.
